# Analysis of Disulfide Bonds in Proteins in the RCSB Databank
Eric G. Suchanek, PhD.
In this Notebook I perform a structural analysis of Disulfide bonds contained in 32,xxx proteins contained in the RCSB structural databank, (https://www.rcsb.org). The analysis utilizes code from the ProteusPy package, and is built upon the excellent *BioPython* library (https://www.biopython.org).
