    "## Analysis of Disulfide Bonds in Proteins Within the RCSB Protein Data Bank\n",
    "*Eric G. Suchanek, PhD. (suchanek@mac.com)* <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "I describe the results of a structural analysis of Disulfide bonds contained in 36,362 proteins within the RCSB Protein databank, https://www.rcsb.org. These protein structures contained 294,478 Disulfide Bonds.  The analysis utilizes Python functions from my ``ProteusPy`` package https://github.com/suchanek/proteusPy/, which is built upon the excellent ``BioPython`` library (https://www.biopython.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "This work represents a reprise of my original Disulfide modeling analysis conducted in 1986 ([publications](#publications) item 1) as part of my dissertation. Given the original Disulfide database contained only 2xx Disulfide Bonds I felt it would be interesting to revisit the RCSB and mine the thousands of new structures. The initial results are described in the cells below.\n",

    "### Requirements\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Disulfide bonds are important covalent stabilizing elements in proteins. They are formed when two Sulphur-containing Cysteine (Cys) amino acid residues are close enough and in the correct geometry to form a S-S covalent bond with their terminal sidechain Sγ atoms. Disulfide bonds most commonly occur between alpha helices and greatly enhance a protein's stability to denaturation. \n"

    "## Extract the Disulfides from the PDB files\n",
    "The function ``Extract_Disulfides()`` processes all the .ent files in ``PDB_DIR`` and creates two .pkl files representing the Disulfide bonds contained in the scanned directory. In addition, a .csv file containing problem IDs is written if any are found. The .pkl files are consumed by the ``DisulfideLoader`` class and are considered private. You'll see numerous warnings during the scan. Files that are unparsable are removed and their IDs are logged to the problem_id.csv file. The default file locations are stored in the file globals.py and are the used by ``DisulfideExtractor()`` in the absence of arguments passed. The Disulfide parser is very stringent and will reject disulfide bonds with missing atoms or disordered atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs are saved in ``MODEL_DIR``:\n",
    "1) ``SS_PICKLE_FILE``: The ``DisulfideList`` of ``Disulfide`` objects initialized from the PDB file scan, needed by the ``DisulfideLoader()`` class.\n",
    "2) ``SS_DICT_PICKLE_FILE``: the ``Dict Disulfide`` objects also needed by the ``DisulfideLoader()`` class\n",
    "3) ``PROBLEM_ID_FILE``: a .csv containining the problem ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the process only needs to be run once for a full scan. Setting the ``numb`` argument to -1 scans the entire directory. Entering a positive number allows parsing a subset of the dataset, which is useful when debugging. Setting ``verbose`` enables verbose messages. Setting ``quiet`` to ``True`` disables all warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: A extraction of the initial disulfide bond-containing files (> 36000 files) takes about 1.25 hours on a 2020 MacbookPro with M1 Pro chip, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD. The resulting .pkl files consume approximately 1GB of disk space, and equivalent RAM used when loaded."

    "## Load the Disulfide Data\n",
    "Now that the Disulfides have been extracted and the Disulfide .pkl files have been created we can load them into memory using the DisulfideLoader() class. This class stores the Disulfides internally as a DisulfideList and a dict. Array indexing operations including slicing have been overloaded, enabling straightforward access to the Disulfide bonds, both in aggregate and by residue. After loading the .pkl files the Class creates a Pandas ``DataFrame`` object consisting of the Disulfide ID, all sidechain dihedral angles, the local coordinates for the Disulfide and the computed Disulfide bond torsional energy.\n",
