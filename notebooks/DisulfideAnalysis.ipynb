    "# Analysis of Disulfide Bonds in Proteins Within the RCSB Protein Data Bank\n",
    "*Eric G. Suchanek, PhD. (suchanek@mac.com)* <br> <br>\n",
    "I describe the results of a structural analysis of Disulfide bonds contained in 36,362 proteins containing 294,478 Disulfide Bonds within the RCSB Protein databank, https://www.rcsb.org. The analysis utilizes Python routines from my ``ProteusPy`` package https://github.com/myml/, which is built upon the excellent ``BioPython`` library (https://www.biopython.org). This work is a reprise of my original Disulfide modeling analysis conducted in 1984 (grab my citation). Given the original Disulfide database only 2xx Disulfide Bonds I felt it would be interesting to revisit the RCSB. The initial results are described in the cells below.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Disulfide bonds are important protein structure stabilizing elements. They are formed when two Sulphur-containing Cysteine (Cys) residues are close enough and in the correct geometry to form a S-S covalent bond with their terminal sidechain Sγ atom. They most commonly occur between alpha helices and greatly enhance a protein's stability to denaturation."

    "The function ``Disulfide.DisulfideExtractor()`` processes all the .ent files in ``PDB_DIR`` and creates two .pkl files representing the Disulfide bonds contained in the scanned directory. In addition, a .csv file containing problem IDs is written if any are found. The .pkl files are consumed by the ``DisulfideLoader`` class and are considered private. You'll see numerous warnings during the scan. Files that are unparsable are removed and their IDs are logged to the problem_id.csv file. The default file locations are stored in the file globals.py and are the used by ``DisulfideExtractor()`` in the absence of arguments passed. The Disulfide parser is very stringent and will reject disulfide bonds with missing atoms or disordered atoms.\n",

    "A full scan of the initial disulfide bond-containing files (> 36000 files) takes about 1.25 hours on a 2020 MacbookPro with M1 Pro chip. The resulting .pkl files consume approximately 1GB of disk space, and equivalent RAM used when loaded.\n",
