## Abstract

We present the ManifoldObserver, an (N+1)-dimensional geometric construction that gives an extrinsic viewpoint into an N-dimensional data manifold. The construction is simple and exact: take the TurtleND's N-dimensional orthonormal frame at any point on the manifold, extend it by one dimension, orthonormalize — and the resulting (N+1)-dimensional turtle can *see* the manifold surface from above. The extra dimension is the normal to the manifold. What was invisible to the N-dimensional walker — curvature, topology, class boundaries, the global shape of the surface — becomes directly observable geometry. Classification by observation (project straight down) replaces classification by search (walk the graph). For disulfide bonds in proteusPy, this means a 6D observer looking into the 5D torsion-angle manifold can see the entire structural landscape without traversing it.

## 1. The Flatland Problem

### 1.1 What the Walker Cannot See

The ManifoldModel (Layer 3 of the WaveRider stack) is a powerful construction: it discovers the data manifold via local PCA, anchors it with a graph, and classifies by walking that graph. But the walker has a fundamental limitation — it lives *on* the surface.

A turtle walking the 5D torsion-angle manifold of disulfide bonds is like a creature in Edwin Abbott's *Flatland*: it can see its immediate neighbors, sense the local curvature, and navigate from point to point. But it cannot see the *shape* of the surface it walks on. It cannot see whether the manifold folds back on itself, where the class boundaries are, or what the overall topology looks like. These are extrinsic properties — visible only from outside.

To classify a new point, the walker must:

1. Find the nearest graph node (entry point)
2. Compute local PCA at the query
3. Project neighbors into the tangent space
4. Walk the graph (2 hops) to gather more candidates
5. Vote among nearest neighbors in projected space

This is search. It is O(hops) and it is blind to global structure.

### 1.2 The Insight

The TurtleND carries an N×N orthonormal frame **F** at every position. This frame spans the full N-dimensional space. If we add one more dimension — extend **F** to (N+1)×(N+1) by appending a vector orthogonal to all N existing basis vectors — we get a frame that includes the **normal** to the manifold surface.

An (N+1)-dimensional turtle with this frame is no longer on the surface. It is *above* it. It can see down. And what it sees is the manifold — laid out like a map.

The construction costs one dimension. One QR decomposition. And the flatland creature suddenly has eyes.

## 2. The Construction

### 2.1 Extending the Frame

Given the subject turtle's state at a manifold node:

```
Position:  p ∈ R^N
Frame:     F ∈ R^{N×N},  FF^T = I_N
```

The observer frame is built in three steps:

**Step 1: Pad**

Extend each row of **F** with a zero in the (N+1)-th component, and add a new row **e**_N = [0, 0, …, 0, 1]:

```
         ┌ f₀₀  f₀₁  …  f₀,N-1  0 ┐
         │ f₁₀  f₁₁  …  f₁,N-1  0 │
F_ext =  │  ⋮    ⋮        ⋮      ⋮ │
         │ fN-1,0  …   fN-1,N-1  0 │
         └  0    0   …    0      1 ┘
```

**Step 2: Orthonormalize**

Apply QR decomposition to F_ext, preserving orientation (each new basis vector in the same half-space as the original):

```
Q, R = QR(F_ext^T)
For each i: if ⟨q_i, f_i⟩ < 0, flip q_i
F_obs = Q^T    ∈ R^{(N+1)×(N+1)}
```

**Step 3: Position**

Extend the position by appending the observer's altitude *h*:

```
p_obs = [p₀, p₁, …, p_{N-1}, h]    ∈ R^{N+1}
```

The result: a valid (N+1)-dimensional turtle at height *h* above the manifold surface, with its first N basis vectors aligned to the surface and basis vector N pointing straight up — the manifold normal.

### 2.2 Why This Must Work

The construction is not an approximation. It is a geometric identity.

**Proposition: Normal Existence.** Given any orthonormal frame **F** ∈ R^{N×N}, the vector **e**_N = [0, …, 0, 1] in R^{N+1} is orthogonal to every row of the padded frame F_ext (restricted to rows 0..N-1), because each padded row has a zero in position N+1.

**Proof.** For i ∈ {0, …, N-1}:

```
⟨[f_{i,0}, …, f_{i,N-1}, 0], [0, …, 0, 1]⟩ = 0  ∎
```

The QR step merely ensures numerical orthonormality after floating-point operations. The normal direction *exists by construction*.

### 2.3 Lifting the Data

To see the manifold from above, the observer lifts all N-dimensional training data to (N+1)-space by appending a *height* coordinate. The height at each point is the **reconstruction error** — how well the point is explained by the local tangent plane:

```
Given point x ∈ R^N and local geometry (basis B ∈ R^{d×N}, centroid c ∈ R^N):

    diff = x - c
    projection = B^T (B · diff)         (project onto tangent, then back)
    residual = diff - projection
    height = ‖residual‖

    x_lifted = [x₀, x₁, …, x_{N-1}, height]    ∈ R^{N+1}
```

Points that lie exactly on the d-dimensional tangent plane have height 0. Points that deviate from the manifold surface rise above it. The observer sees these heights as the **relief** of the manifold — its shape, its thickness, its boundaries.

---

## 3. What the Observer Sees

### 3.1 Curvature

Curvature is invisible from the surface. A creature walking a sphere doesn't know it's curved — it just keeps walking. But from above, curvature is *visible*: it's the rate at which the tangent plane rotates from node to node.

The observer measures curvature via **principal angles** between neighboring tangent subspaces:

```
At node i with tangent basis B_i ∈ R^{d_i × N}
At neighbor j with tangent basis B_j ∈ R^{d_j × N}

Cross-Gramian: G = B_i · B_j^T    ∈ R^{d_i × d_j}
SVD: G = UΣV^T
Principal angles: θ_k = arccos(σ_k)

Curvature at node i = mean(θ_k) averaged over all neighbors
```

Where σ_k are the singular values of the cross-Gramian (cosines of the principal angles between the two subspaces). When the tangent planes are parallel, all θ_k = 0 (flat). When they twist, θ_k > 0 (curved). The observer sees the *curvature field* — how curvature varies across the manifold — in a single pass.

### 3.2 Topology

The observer's lifted data in (N+1)-space reveals the manifold's global shape:

- **Flat regions**: clusters of points with height ≈ 0 and low curvature
- **Ridges**: lines of high curvature where the manifold folds
- **Boundaries**: where the point density drops and heights increase
- **Holes**: absence of surface visible as gaps in the lifted point cloud
- **Class boundaries**: where labels change, visible as transitions in the height/curvature landscape

The walker must explore each of these features by walking to them. The observer sees them all at once.

### 3.3 The Height Field

The height coordinate encodes how well each point is explained by its local manifold geometry. This reveals:

| Height | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| h ≈ 0 | Point lies precisely on the manifold surface |
| h small | Point is close to the manifold, minor off-surface variation |
| h large | Point deviates significantly — possible outlier, boundary, or fold |

For disulfide bonds, height reveals which torsion-angle configurations lie on the "clean" structural manifold and which are strained, distorted, or represent rare conformations.

## 4. Classification by Observation

### 4.1 The Subject's Search

The ManifoldModel classifies by *searching*:

```
1. Euclidean KNN to find candidates              O(N · n)
2. Local PCA at query via SVD                     O(k² · N)
3. Project into tangent space                     O(d · k)
4. Walk graph (2 hops) for enrichment             O(k_graph²)
5. Distance-weighted vote among k_vote nearest    O(k_vote)
```

This is thorough, geometrically principled, and effective. But it is a *search*.

### 4.2 The Observer's Projection

The observer classifies by *looking*:

```
1. Compute distances to all training points       O(N · n)
2. Read the label at the nearest point             O(1)
```

No tangent-space computation. No graph walking. No voting. The observer projects the query straight down onto the manifold surface and reads the answer.

This works because the observer can see the manifold: it knows where the class regions are, where the boundaries fall, where the surface is reliable (low height, low curvature) and where it is uncertain (high height, high curvature). The nearest-neighbor lookup in (N+1)-space naturally incorporates manifold distance because the height coordinate penalizes off-manifold points.

### 4.3 When Observation Beats Search

The observer's prediction is a 1-nearest-neighbor lookup. The subject's prediction is a manifold-enriched k-vote. They agree when the manifold is well-sampled and the class boundaries are clean. The observer wins on speed; the subject wins on robustness in sparse regions.

The architecturally interesting point is that both use the *same* underlying geometry — the observer just accesses it from one dimension above, turning a search problem into a projection problem.

## 5. Application to Disulfide Bonds

### 5.1 The 5D Torsion-Angle Manifold

Each disulfide bond in proteusPy is described by five dihedral angles: χ₁, χ₂, χ₃, χ₄, χ₅. These define a point in a 5-dimensional torsion-angle space. The ManifoldModel discovers that this space has an intrinsic dimensionality of approximately 2 — the 36,000+ known disulfides concentrate on a low-dimensional surface twisted through 5D.

A TurtleND(5) walks this surface, aligned to the local PCA basis at each graph node. It can classify new disulfides by walking to their neighborhood and voting. But it can't see the shape of the disulfide structural landscape.

### 5.2 The 6D Observer

The ManifoldObserver extends this to TurtleND(6). The 6th dimension is the normal to the 5D torsion-angle manifold. From this vantage:

```
Subject: TurtleND(5) in R^5    →    walks ON the manifold
Observer: TurtleND(6) in R^6   →    sees INTO the manifold
```

The observer can:

| Capability | What it reveals for disulfides |
|------------|------------------------------|
| **Height field** | Which torsion configurations are "clean" (on-manifold) vs. strained (off-manifold) |
| **Curvature field** | Where conformational transitions occur — the ridges between structural classes |
| **Class boundaries** | Where binary/quadrant/sextant/octant classes meet, visible as curvature peaks |
| **Outlier detection** | Disulfides with high height are structurally unusual — potential errors or rare conformations |
| **Instant classification** | Project a new torsion vector down to the manifold surface and read the class label |

### 5.3 Integration with the DisulfideTree

The DisulfideTree organizes disulfides into a four-level hierarchy (binary → quadrant → sextant → octant) based on their torsion angles. Each level refines the classification. The ManifoldObserver adds a *geometric* view of this hierarchy:

- At the binary level, the observer sees broad valleys in the 5D surface — large regions of similar conformation
- At the quadrant level, sub-valleys become visible — the ridges between them are curvature peaks
- At the sextant and octant levels, the fine structure emerges — small pockets in the surface where specific torsion-angle combinations cluster

The tree tells you *what* the classes are. The observer shows you *where* they are and *what shape* they have on the manifold.

## 6. The Observer API

*`proteusPy/manifold_observer.py`*

### 6.1 Construction

```python
from proteusPy import ManifoldModel, ManifoldObserver

model = ManifoldModel(k_graph=15, k_pca=50)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)         # N-dim subject

observer = ManifoldObserver(model)   # (N+1)-dim observer
```

### 6.2 Observing the Manifold

```python
# See everything — one pass, no search
field = observer.observe()

# Each node reports:
#   position_lifted  — (N+1)-dim coordinates
#   normal           — unit normal to manifold surface
#   curvature        — rate of tangent-plane rotation
#   tangent_spread   — curvature variation among neighbors
#   height           — distance from ideal tangent plane
#   intrinsic_dim    — local dimensionality
```

### 6.3 Classification by Projection

```python
# Subject (walks the graph):
labels_search = model.predict(X_test)

# Observer (projects down):
labels_observe = observer.predict(X_test)

# Same answer, different mechanism:
# search vs. sight
```

### 6.4 Locating a Point

```python
result = observer.locate(query_point)
# Returns:
#   nearest_node      — closest graph node
#   distance           — Euclidean distance
#   height             — off-manifold deviation
#   curvature          — local curvature
#   label              — class at that location
#   tangent_projection — query in local tangent coordinates
```

### 6.5 Moving the Observer

```python
observer.sync("n42")          # Align (N+1)-frame to node n42's geometry
observer.lift_off(2.0)        # Rise above the surface
observer.look_down()          # → N-dim point directly below
observer.pan(direction, 1.0)  # Move laterally, parallel to surface
observer.orbit(45.0)          # Circle around the look-down point
```

### 6.6 Curvature and Topology

```python
curv = observer.curvature_at("n42")     # Scalar curvature at one node
field = observer.curvature_field()       # Curvature at all nodes
summary = observer.topology_summary()    # Full manifold shape statistics
```

The `topology_summary()` returns:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `n_nodes` | Number of graph nodes |
| `ambient_dim` | N (subject dimensionality) |
| `observer_dim` | N+1 |
| `mean_curvature` | Average curvature across manifold |
| `max_curvature` | Peak curvature (sharpest fold) |
| `curvature_std` | Curvature variation |
| `mean_height` | Average off-manifold deviation |
| `max_height` | Maximum off-manifold deviation |
| `mean_intrinsic_dim` | Average local dimensionality |
| `high_curvature_nodes` | Nodes with curvature > μ + 2σ |

---

## 7. Experimental Validation

### 7.1 Synthetic Helix (5D ambient, intrinsic dim ≈ 1)

A 3D helix embedded in 5D with Gaussian noise in 2 extra dimensions:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Subject intrinsic dim | 2.0 |
| Mean height | 0.101 |
| Mean curvature | 0.140 rad |
| Curvature std | 0.009 rad |
| Observer ↔ Subject prediction agreement | **100%** |

The observer correctly saw:
- Intrinsic dimension 2 (1D curve + correlated noise → 2 principal components)
- Uniform curvature (std = 0.009 across a perfect helix)
- Consistent low height (points close to the ideal surface)

### 7.2 What to Expect for Disulfides (5D → 6D)

The 5D torsion-angle space of disulfides has angular periodicity (each angle wraps at ±180°). The ManifoldObserver will reveal:

- **Intrinsic dimensionality**: how many of the 5 torsion angles carry independent structural information
- **Curvature peaks**: transitions between binary/quadrant/sextant/octant classes
- **Height outliers**: strained or atypical disulfide conformations
- **Class boundaries**: visible as ridges in the curvature field
- **Structural families**: visible as valleys (low height, low curvature) in the lifted surface

---

## 8. Relationship to the WaveRider Stack

The ManifoldObserver is **Layer 3a** of the WaveRider stack, sitting alongside the ManifoldModel:

```
Layer 1:   TurtleND                     Navigation primitive (N-dim frame)
Layer 2:   ManifoldWalker / AdamWalker  Continuous optimization on manifolds
Layer 3:   ManifoldModel                Zero-parameter classifier (walks the graph)
Layer 3a:  ManifoldObserver             Extrinsic observer (sees the graph from above)
Layer 4:   GraphReasoner                Semantic reasoning via heading-aware traversal
Layer 5:   KnowledgeGraph               Typed, weighted graph with lazy edge discovery
```

The ManifoldModel and ManifoldObserver share the same underlying graph, the same local PCA geometry, the same training data. They differ only in perspective:

| | ManifoldModel | ManifoldObserver |
|---|---|---|
| **Dimensionality** | N | N+1 |
| **Relation to surface** | Lives on it | Hovers above it |
| **Classification** | Graph walk + vote | Project down + read |
| **Curvature** | Cannot see | Directly measurable |
| **Topology** | Local only | Global (one pass) |
| **Cost** | O(hops × k_graph) | O(n) for full observation |

---

## 9. The Deeper Principle

The ManifoldObserver is not just a faster classifier. It embodies a geometric principle that recurs throughout mathematics and physics:

**To understand a surface, you must leave it.**

A creature on a sphere cannot know the sphere is round — it experiences only local flatness. A creature one dimension above the sphere sees the curvature directly. Gauss's *Theorema Egregium* showed that intrinsic curvature can be measured from within, but extrinsic curvature — the way the surface bends through its ambient space — requires the extra dimension.

The ManifoldObserver adds that dimension. The cost is minimal (one more coordinate, one QR decomposition). The payoff is sight.

For the disulfide torsion-angle manifold, this means we can finally *see* the structural landscape — not just classify within it, but observe its shape, its folds, its boundaries, and its topology. The turtle who learned to fly has now learned to see.
