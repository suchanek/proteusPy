# Analysis of Disulfide Bonds in Proteins Within the RCSB Protein Data Bank
*Eric G. Suchanek, PhD. (suchanek@mac.com)* <br>

## Summary
I have performed a structural analysis of Disulfide bonds contained in 36,362 proteins within the RCSB Protein databank, https://www.rcsb.org. These protein structures contained 294,478 Disulfide Bonds  The conformational analysis utilizes Python routines from my ``ProteusPy`` package https://github.com/suchanek/proteusPy/, which is built upon the excellent ``BioPython`` library (https://www.biopython.org). 

This work is a reprise of my original Disulfide modeling analysis conducted in 1986 ([publications](#publications) item 1) as part of my dissertation. Given the original Disulfide database contained only 2xx Disulfide Bonds I felt it would be interesting to revisit the RCSB and mine the thousands of new structures. The initial results are described in the cells below.


## Introduction
Disulfide bonds are important covalent stabilizing elements in proteins. They are formed when two Sulphur-containing Cysteine (Cys) amino acid residues are close enough and in the correct geometry to form a S-S covalent bond with their terminal sidechain SÎ³ atoms. Disulfide bonds most commonly occur between alpha helices and greatly enhance a protein's stability to denaturation. 

## Extract the Disulfides from the PDB files
The function ``ExtractDisulfides()`` processes all the .ent files in ``PDB_DIR`` and creates two .pkl files representing the Disulfide bonds contained in the scanned directory. In addition, a .csv file containing problem IDs is written if any are found. The .pkl files are consumed by the ``DisulfideLoader`` class and are considered private. You'll see numerous warnings during the scan. Files that are unparsable are removed and their IDs are logged to the problem_id.csv file. The default file locations are stored in the file globals.py and are the used by ``ExtractDisulfides()`` in the absence of arguments passed. The Disulfide parser is very stringent and will reject disulfide bonds with missing atoms or disordered atoms.

A full scan of the initial disulfide bond-containing files (> 36000 files) takes about 1.25 hours on a 2020 MacbookPro with M1 Pro chip. The resulting .pkl files consume approximately 1GB of disk space, and equivalent RAM used when loaded.

Outputs are saved in ``MODEL_DIR``:
1) ``SS_PICKLE_FILE``: The ``DisulfideList`` of ``Disulfide`` objects initialized from the PDB file scan, needed by the ``DisulfideLoader()`` class.
2) ``SS_DICT_PICKLE_FILE``: the ``Dict Disulfide`` objects also needed by the ``DisulfideLoader()`` class
3) ``PROBLEM_ID_FILE``: a .csv containining the problem ids.

In general, the process only needs to be run once for a full scan. Setting the ``numb`` argument to -1 scans the entire directory. Entering a positive number allows parsing a subset of the dataset, which is useful when debugging. Setting ``verbose`` enables verbose messages. Setting ``quiet`` to ``True`` disables all warnings.
