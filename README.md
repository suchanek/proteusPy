A package for the modeling and analysis of proteins of known structure with an emphasis on Disulfide Bonds. This package reprises my molecular modeling and analysis program [Proteus](https://doi.org/10.1021/bi00368a023), The package relies on the ``Turtle3D`` class, which implements a three-dimensional 'Turtle'. The turtle implements ``Move``, ``Roll``, ``Yaw``, ``Pitch`` and ``Turn`` for movement in a three-dimensional space. The ```DisulfideBond``` class implements the protein structure stabilizing element known as a Disulfide Bond. This class and its underlying methods are being used to perform an analysis of proteins contained in the RCSB protein data bank.
