# proteusPy
A package for the modeling and analysis of proteins of known structure.
This package reprises my molecular modeling and analysis program *Proteus*  
(https://doi.org/10.1021/bi00368a023), The package relies on my ``Turtle3D`` 
class, which implements a three-dimensional 'Turtle'. The turtle 
implements ``Move``, ``Roll``, ``Yaw``, ``Pitch`` and ``Turn`` for movement 
in a three-dimensional space. The DisulfideBond class implements the protein
structure stabilizing element known as a Disulfide Bond. This is used to perform 
an analysis of over 292,000 disulfide bonds contained in 32,xxx proteins contained 
in the RCSB protein data bank.
