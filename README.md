*proteusPy* is a python package specializing on the modeling and analysis of proteins of known structure with an emphasis on Disulfide Bonds. This package reprises my molecular modeling and analysis program [Proteus](https://doi.org/10.1021/bi00368a023), and relies heavily on the [Turtle3D](https://suchanek.github.io/proteusPy/turtle3D.html) class. The turtle implements the functions ``Move``, ``Roll``, ``Yaw``, ``Pitch`` and ``Turn`` for movement in a three-dimensional space. The [Disulfide](https://suchanek.github.io/proteusPy/Disulfide.html)class implements the protein structure stabilizing element known as a Disulfide Bond. This class and its underlying methods are being used to perform a structural analysis of over 292,000 disulfide-bond containing proteins in the RCSB protein data bank.
