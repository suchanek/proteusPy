# proteusPy
A package for the modeling and analysis of proteins of known structure.
This package reprises my molecular modeling and analysis program *Proteus* (citation), used for modeling proteins of known structure. The package relies on my ``Turtle3D`` class, which implements a three-dimensional 'Turtle'. The turtle implements ``Move``, ``Roll``, ``Yaw``, ``Pitch`` and ``Turn`` for movement in a three-dimensional space. The DisulfideBond class implements the protein structure stabilizing element known as a Disulfide Bond. This is used to perform an analysis of proteins contained in the RCSB protein data bank.
